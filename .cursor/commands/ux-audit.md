Analyze the following section/screen/feature:
[PASTE SCREENSHOT / DESCRIPTION / CODE / LINK HERE]

Provide a comprehensive, structured improvement plan with the following sections:

1. Quick Wins (2–4 changes that can be implemented in <1 day and have high impact)
2. Overall Assessment

   - What’s working well
   - Main pain points and usability issues
   - How well it aligns with user goals and business objectives

3. Prioritized Recommendations (use a table or numbered list with columns: Priority (P0/P1/P2), Effort (Low/Medium/High), Expected Impact, Description + Rationale)

4. Redesigned Concept (describe in detail a new version: layout, visual hierarchy, copy changes, interaction improvements, micro-copy, spacing, typography, color usage, accessibility improvements, etc.)

5. Specific Copy & Micro-copy Suggestions (if applicable)

6. Visual/Mockup Description (describe exactly what the improved version would look like so someone could build or sketch it immediately)

7. Supporting Data / Best Practices / References (briefly mention relevant Nielsen heuristics, Material/HIG guidelines, conversion studies, etc. that back your suggestions)

8. Potential A/B Test Ideas (2–3 concrete experiments you would run to validate the improvements)

Be opinionated, direct, and extremely detailed. Prioritize clarity, speed, trust, and delight. Never suggest minor cosmetic changes without strong justification. Focus on outcomes, not just aesthetics.
